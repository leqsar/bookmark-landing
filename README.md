- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue framework
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs-dev.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=ru&_x_tr_hl=ru&_x_tr_pto=sc)

### What I learned

- How to work with SVG's fill and viewBox;
- Pass image's src correctly with Vue;
- Bind state's variables to style's properties;

- Reminded myself of how mixins work in SASS;

### Continued development

I'll stick to learning VUE. There is still a lot of info I don't know. In the closest future i want to develop app with API requests using VUE.
Also I want to create some more complicated animations using GSAP.
